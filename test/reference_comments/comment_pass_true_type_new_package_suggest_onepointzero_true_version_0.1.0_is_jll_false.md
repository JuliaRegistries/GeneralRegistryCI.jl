On a separate note, I see that you are registering a release with a version number of the form `v0.X.Y`.

Does your package have a stable public API? If so, then it's time for you to register version `v1.0.0` of your package. (This is not a requirement. It's just a recommendation.)

If your package does not yet have a stable public API, then of course you are not yet ready to release version `v1.0.0`.

RegistryCI provides continuous integration (CI) tools, including automated testing and automatic merging (automerge) of pull requests.

The [General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) registry uses RegistryCI.

You can also use RegistryCI for your own Julia package registry.

## Automatic merging guidelines

For the list of automatic merging guidelines, please see the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md#automatic-merging-of-pull-requests).

## RegistryCI.jl integration tests

For instructions on how to run the RegistryCI.jl integration tests on your local machine, see [`INTEGRATION_TESTS.md`](INTEGRATION_TESTS.md).

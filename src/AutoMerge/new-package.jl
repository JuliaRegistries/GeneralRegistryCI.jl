    # Rules:
    # 1. Registry consistency tests pass
    # 2.  Only changes a subset of the following files:
    #         - `Registry.toml`,
    #         - `E/Example/Compat.toml`
    #         - `E/Example/Deps.toml`
    #         - `E/Example/Package.toml`
    #         - `E/Example/Versions.toml`
    # 3.  TODO: implement this check. When implemented, this check will make sure that the changes to `Registry.toml` only modify the specified package.
    # 4.  Normal capitalization
    #         - name should match r"^[A-Z]\w*[a-z]\w*[0-9]?$"
    #         - i.e. starts with a capital letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, contains at least 1 lowercase letter
    # 5.  Not too short
    #         - at least five letters
    #         - you can register names shorter than this, but doing so requires someone to approve
    # 6.  Meets julia name check
    #         - does not include the string "julia" with any case
    #         - does not start with "Ju"
    # 7.  DISABLED. Standard initial version number - one of 0.0.1, 0.1.0, 1.0.0, X.0.0
    #         - does not apply to JLL packages
    # 8.  Repo URL ends with /$name.jl.git where name is the package name. We only apply this check if the package is not a subdirectory package.
    # 9.  Compat for Julia
    #         - there should be a [compat] entry for Julia
    #         - the Julia [compat] should have an upper bound
    #         - the Julia [compat] upper bound must have major version 1
    # 10.  Compat for all dependencies
    #         - there should be a [compat] entry for Julia
    #         - all [deps] should also have [compat] entries
    #         - all [compat] entries should have upper bounds
    #         - dependencies that are standard libraries do not need [compat] entries
    #         - dependencies that are JLL packages do not need [compat] entries
    # 11. (only applies to JLL packages) The only dependencies of the package are:
    #         - Pkg
    #         - Libdl
    #         - other JLL packages
    # 12. Package's name has only ASCII characters
    # 13. Version can be installed
    #         - given the proposed changes to the registry, can we resolve and install the new version of the package?
    #         - i.e. can we run `Pkg.add("Foo")`
    # 14. Package code can be downloaded. Can we `git clone` the repo and get the files corresponding to the tree hash in the PR?
    #       - and does that tree hash match what we get by looking at the subdir + commit the registration was triggered from?
    # 15. Package repository contains only OSI-approved license(s) in the license file at toplevel in the version being registered
    # 16. Version can be loaded
    #         - once it's been installed (and built?), can we load the code?
    #         - i.e. can we run `import Foo`
    # 17. Dependency confusion check
    #         - Package UUID doesn't conflict with an UUID in the provided
    #           list of package registries. The exception is if also the
    #           package name *and* package URL matches those in the other
    #           registry, in which case this is a valid co-registration.
    # 18. Package's name is sufficiently far from existing package names in the registry
    #         - We always run this check last.
    #         - We exclude JLL packages from the "existing names"
    #         - We use three checks:
    #             i. that the lowercased name is at least 1 away in Damerau Levenshtein distance from any other lowercased name
    #             ii. that the name is at least 2 away in Damerau Levenshtein distance from any other name
    #             iii. that the name is sufficiently far in a visual distance from any other name
